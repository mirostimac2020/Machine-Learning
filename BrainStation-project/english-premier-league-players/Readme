English Premier League Players Dataset, Season 2017/18 A unique dataset containing FPL data, popularity and market values

Overview The specific objective of this project was to investigate the Market Values variation of different players and what things they depend on/what are the factors affecting them.Our goal was to compare market value of the players. Contested by twenty clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL).

Context For most football fans, May - July represents a lull period due to the lack of club football.
