Avocado has become one of the world's trendiest foods.
As the poster child of millennial healthy eating, this superfood is now a mainstay for foodies everywhere. 
But have you noticed your avo on toast is costing more and more? 
Avocado prices have rocketed in recent years by up to 129%, with the average national price of a single Hass avocado reaching $2.10 in 2019,
almost doubling in just one year.
The average American eats 7 pounds of guacamole a year, up from 1.1 pounds in 1989, according to Agriculture Marketing Resource Center,
a research group that receives grants from the USDA. By Patrick Gillespie  CNNMoney, Sep 11 2017.
